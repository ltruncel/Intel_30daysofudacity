# Intel_30daysofudacity

### Hi! LauraT here.  In early 2020 I began the Intel Edge AI scholarship while working on the final stage of my deep learning nanodegree.  This is the 30-day coding/learning challnege I compelted during that time.  I did a total of 60 days for this particular challenge. :smile: <br>
